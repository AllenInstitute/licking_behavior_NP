# licking_behavior
Analysis of mouse licking behavior during visually guided behavior
Predicting licking during a visual change detection task
Background knowledge:
Highly recommend reading these tutorial slides: https://pillowlab.princeton.edu/pubs/pillow_TutorialSlides_Cosyne2018.pdf
Highly recommend reading/scanning this paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3800
Topics to know: GLMs, Poisson likelihood, maximum likelihood estimation / function optimization (probably just gradient descent), convolution (as needed, depending on what aspects you are working on).

Personal Goals. List here your personal goals for what you hope to learn during this project. We’ll use these goals to make sure everyone learns something new. 
Alex - How to organize and manage a group project. How to perform optimization in python/scipy (I’m new to python). Getting some experience with the new Allen SDK for visual behavior. 
Nick - ??
Kate -  ??
Ildefons -  ??

Personal Scientific Interests. List here your personal interests for this project. That is, what are you most interested in working on? Well use these interests to make a plan of attack for next week. 
Alex  - post-licking filters. How does licking create short-timescale changes in licking probability like bursts of licking. Quantifying running speed/licking interactions that everyone talks about, but no one has really modelled ( to my knowledge). Can we separate a post-licking timing vs a post-reward timing strategy?

Specific Goals: This is a list of concrete steps that we would like to achieve during the project. 
Fit a model with running speed
Fit a model with post-licking filter
Fit a model with post-reward filter
Fit a model with pupil diameter
Fit a model with time-from-image-onset
Fit a model with facial features
Fit a model with total water volume
Measure feature consistency across mice
Measure feature consistency across sessions.
Measure feature consistency within one session
